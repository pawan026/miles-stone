            <header><b>A BRIEF HISTORY</b> </header><br>
            <p>HTML5 is a markup language that was founded in 2004 by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) whose members include Apple, Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software. Then in Oct 2006 W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) decided to stop their work on XHTML and start collaborating with "WHATWG" to develop HTML as a technology. After that, the first version of HTML5 was published in 2008 that was written by Ian Hickson, Google, ian@hixie.ch. But it's not completed and changes are still remaining because according to WHATWG experts "HTML5 is a continually evolving technology that will never end". After the first draft of HTML5, it's time to make compatible browsers that support HTML5 features. And then Mozilla took the first step and introduced 'Firefox 3' that allows users to view HTML5 in the browser, but Safari, Google Chrome, and IE were far behind in support of HTML5 features in their browsers. HTML5 was gaining popularity day by day. Then in April 2010, Steve Jobs declared that flash will never be allowed on Apple's smart devices. He said that "Flash was designed for PCs using a mouse, not for touch screens using fingers". This statement is enough to change the mind of many companies and that's the reason they began the development of HTML5.<br><br>
 
                Changes then began in the web world, Scribd, which is an online document sharing site eliminated flash completely and rebuilt their site in HTML5. It helped them to create a better and effective UI for their user's reading documents on tablets. But it was just a beginning, in Aug 2010 Arcade Fire's made an HTML5-based interactive film called "The Wilderness Downtown' that won the Grand Prix award at the Cannes advertising awards in the Cyber Category. After 3 months in Dec 2010, Google introduced "Chrome Web Store" that was in HTML5 where a user can easily buy non-Apple web apps on tablets.<br><br>
                 
                In March 2011, a big news revealed that "Disney buys HTML5 gaming start-up".  Rocket Pack was a HTML5 based gaming engine start-up. They wanted to break the app-store proprietorship so they can build HTML5 based games directly in the web. Then in July 2011, Pandora begins to make a HTML5 based audio player. And that's a much better audio player than Flash player, it is easier to load and faster too. In Aug 2011, Amazon creates a new web based version app for Kindle eBook reader. It allows users to access offline content directly from their browser. In Aug, Twitter launched their new HTML5 version app for iPad. In Sept. 2011, according to Alexa HTML5 was used by 34% of top 100 trafficked websites. HTML5 become more popular on the web and that's the main reason Adobe stopped making Flash for mobile devices. In April 2012, Flicker include a new HTML5 uploader. HTML5 is a big boom in the market and according to a research by Strategy Analytics there are over one billion HTML5 compatible smartphones that will be sold this year.<br><br>

              <p style="font-size: 20px;" > <strong style="font-size: 30px;"> Difference Among the WHAT WG, HTML WG, and W3</strong><br><br>
                 
               <ins> WHAT WG</ins>:The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) is a growing community that was founded by the Mozilla Foundation, Opera Software and Apple in 2004. It was formed after a W3C workshop when all members got hyped up by the W3C direction with XHTML. According to them HTML is what the real-world needs. So these organizations set their mission where the existing HTML was extended and the WHAT WG was born.<br><br>
                 
               <ins> HTML WG</ins>:When W3C finally accepted that XHTML 2.0 was not the future they decided to work with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) on development of HTML5. They introduced the HTML WG for this.<br><br>
                 
               <ins> W3C</ins>:The World Wide Web Consortium is a community that develops web standards.<br><br></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong style="font-size: 30px;"> Browser Support</strong><br><br>
              HTML5 is still in development, that's the reason no browser has full HTML5 support. But it doesn't mean that browsers are not compatible because all major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer 9+) supports HTML5 and they are continually adding new features to HTML5 in their latest versions. You can also check a browser's compatibility through HTML5Test.com.

                  <strong style="font-size:30px;">Why Is HTML5 The Future?</strong><br><br>
                  Technology in web development is evolving with each passing day. According to statistics, around 60% developers have already used HTML5 for developing major projects. Close to 20% native mobile developers are now relying on traditional technology lesser than before. This makes it quite evident that HTML5 is becoming the new platform of choice. It is only a matter of time before development through HTML5 overtakes all other native development methods.<br><br>
                  There will always be people who believe they need native mobile applications for more important platforms. However, most developers are now choosing to hop on the “working smart and not hard” bandwagon. In the near future, a web application will be required to work with most of the mobile platforms, if not all. This is basically why HTML5 is believed to be an important tool in future web development.
