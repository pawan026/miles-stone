    <p style="font-family: BELL MT;">HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

        HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>

        <p style="font-family: BELL MT;">The Markup Validation Service is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Internet users to check HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup. Markup validation is an important step towards ensuring the technical quality of web pages. However, it is not a complete measure of web standards conformance. Though W3C validation is important for browser compatibility and site usability, it has not been confirmed what effect it has on search engine optimization.Many major web browsers are often tolerant of certain types of error, and may display a document successfully even if it is not syntactically correct. Certain other XML documents can also be validated if they refer to an internal or external DTD.<br><br>
            Validation is the answer! There are many tools available, from the W3C and other places, that allow you to validate the code on your sites. The most common validators you’ll use are:<br><br>

<b><ins>Validator.nu:</ins></b> A new-school validator that validates HTML5, ARIA, SVG 1.1 and MathML 2.0, it checks the entire document pointing out places where your markup doesn’t follow that doctype correctly (i.e., where there are errors). This is the one we recommend if you are using the HTML5 doctype, also highly recommended.<br><br>
<b><ins>The W3C MarkUp Validator:</ins></b> This looks at the (X)HTML doctype for the document you want to check, and then validates your markup accordingly. This is the one we recommend if you are using an HTML4 or XHTML1.x doctype. It does validate HTML5, but validator.nu is arguably more up to date.<br><br>
<b><ins>The W3C Link Checker:</ins></b> This checks a document, and tests all the links to make sure they are not broken (e.g., that the values point to resources that actually exist).<br><br>
<b><ins>The W3C CSS Validator:</ins></b> This checks a CSS (or HTML/CSS) document and verifies that the CSS follows the specs properly.<br><br>
In this article, we will cover how to use the second of these, demonstrating how to validate markup and interpret the typical kinds of results the validator gives you.</p>
